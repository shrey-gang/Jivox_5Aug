Jivox Hackthon Coding challenge..

This code shows time in analog form for two different time zones, IST and UTC only.
We can extend it further to support other time zones also by using different libraries like moment.js,timezone.js etc.
I used the approach of diffining the difference in time zones.
For developing this I used HTML, jQuery/JavaScript, CSS(bootstrap).
