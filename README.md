Jivox Hackthon Coding challenge..

This code shows time in analog form for two different time zones, IST and UTC only.
I used the approach of diffining the difference in time zones, via difference in times between each time zone.
The alternate way for the same is using libraries such as moment.js,timezone.js etc, but to solve our purpose we have avoided using external libraries.

For developing this I used HTML, jQuery/JavaScript, CSS(bootstrap).
